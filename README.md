# Web-Design-Challenge

## Summary

Create a Web Visualization Dashboard of weather in more that 500 cities at different latitudes relative to the equator line. 

Create individual pages for each plot and a means by which a user can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. Also it will have a landing page, a comparison of all of the plots, and another page with the data used to build them.

## Instructions
The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section (notice the background color change).
