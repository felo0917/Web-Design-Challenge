# Web-Design-Project

## Summary

Created a Web Visualization Dashboard of weather in more that 500 cities at different latitudes relative to the equator line. 

Created individual pages for each plot and a means by which a user can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We will also have a landing page, a comparison of all of the plots, and another page with the data used to build them.

## Tools Used

* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap
